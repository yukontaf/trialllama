When your Apple Watch detects a severe car crash, it will display an alert and\n\nautomatically initiate an emergency phone call after 20 seconds unless you cancel. If you\n\nare unresponsive, it will play an audio message for emergency services, which informs\n\nthem that you’ve been in a severe car crash and gives them your latitudinal and longitudinal\n\ncoordinates with an approximate search radius. To call emergency services, your Apple Watch or nearby iPhone needs a cellular\n\nconnection, or needs to have Wi-Fi calling turned on and Wi-Fi coverage available. If cellular and Wi-Fi coverage are not available, and your iPhone 14 or iPhone 14 Pro or\n\nlater is near your Apple Watch, Crash Detection notifications to emergency services may\n\nbe communicated by the Emergency SOS via satellite system, where Emergency SOS via\n\nsatellite is available.

If you have known skin\n\nsensitivities, please take special care when wearing Apple Watch. You may be more likely\n\nto experience irritation from Apple Watch if you wear it too tightly. Remove Apple Watch\n\nperiodically to allow your skin to breathe. Keeping Apple Watch and the band clean and dry\n\nwill reduce the possibility of skin irritation. If you experience redness, swelling, itchiness,\n\nor any other irritation or discomfort on your skin around, or beneath, your Apple Watch,\n\nplease remove Apple Watch and consult your physician before resuming wear. Continued\n\nuse, even after symptoms subside, may result in renewed or increased irritation. Apple Watch models with a stainless steel or aluminum case, the stainless steel portions of\n\nsome Apple Watch bands, the metallic portions of Hermès bands, and the magnets in the\n\nwatch and bands contain some nickel. Nickel exposure from these materials is unlikely,\n\nbut customers with known nickel allergies should be attentive when wearing them until they\n\ncan determine they are not experiencing an allergic reaction. The Apple Watch case and the Apple Watch bands contain trace amounts of acrylates and\n\nmethacrylates. Acrylates and methacrylates are found in many consumer products that\n\ncome in contact with the skin, such as adhesive bandages. Some people may be sensitive\n\nto them, or may develop sensitivities over time. Apple Watch and its bands are designed so\n\nthat parts containing acrylates and methacrylates are not in direct contact with your skin. The materials used in Apple Watch and the Apple Watch bands meet the standards\n\nset for jewelry by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, applicable European\n\nregulations, and other international standards.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"E3waDsSgsJghinqE/kBnR6uJbTJQq+et80wzK7H2/k0="},"047f0b8c-2ffe-4856-a4d0-34f21c3ac1a9":{"id_":"047f0b8c-2ffe-4856-a4d0-34f21c3ac1a9","metadata":{"page_number":384,"total_pages":394},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"bf91894a-5951-44c3-b3c3-300b0900b8d3","metadata":{"page_number":384,"total_pages":394},"hash":"Bf5GJmm0KNwixIbV5+P9/dCeXQrYYW5WPvY8t0j8EUM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"5ead8fa7-dd47-41a3-94cf-94b95c1d8265","metadata":{"page_number":384,"total_pages":394},"hash":"E3waDsSgsJghinqE/kBnR6uJbTJQq+et80wzK7H2/k0="}},"text":"Consumer Product Safety Commission, applicable European\n\nregulations, and other international standards.

If necessary, you can also\n\nlightly dampen the cloth with fresh water. •\n \nDry Apple Watch with a nonabrasive, lint-free cloth. To help avoid damaging Apple Watch, observe the following:\n\n•\n \nDon’t clean Apple Watch while it’s charging. •\n \nDon’t dry Apple Watch or the bands using any external heat source (for example,\n\na hair dryer). •\n \nDon’t use cleaning products, ultrasonic cleaners, or compressed air when cleaning your\n\nApple Watch. •\n \nDon’t insert objects into any opening or port on Apple Watch. The front of Apple Watch is made of Ion-X glass (strengthened glass) or sapphire crystal,\n\neach with a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic (oil repellent) coating. This coating wears over\n\ntime with normal usage. Cleaning products and abrasive materials will further diminish the\n\ncoating, and may scratch the glass or the sapphire crystal. Using buttons, Digital Crown, connectors, and ports\n \nNever apply excessive pressure\n\nto a button or the Digital Crown on Apple Watch, or force a charging connector into\n\na port, because this may cause damage that is not covered under the warranty. If the\n\nconnector and port don’t join with reasonable ease, they probably don’t match. Check\n\nfor obstructions and make sure that the connector matches the port and that you have\n\npositioned the connector correctly in relation to the port. Certain usage patterns can contribute to the fraying or breaking of cables. The cable\n\nattached to a charging unit, like any other metal wire or cable, is subject to becoming weak\n\nor brittle if repeatedly bent in the same spot. Aim for gentle curves instead of angles in\n\nthe cable. Regularly inspect the cable and connector for any kinks, breaks, bends, or other\n\ndamage. Should you find any such damage, discontinue use of the cable.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"J3AxiqUqmL7di236oYsyJEvSOAzdiV+UfbXVvg2Hscg="},"a4079959-cb88-406f-b09e-62a1fcc64be6":{"id_":"a4079959-cb88-406f-b09e-62a1fcc64be6","metadata":{"page_number":386,"total_pages":394},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"2a6a5677-21a5-48b9-9778-ff6062cc0521","metadata":{"page_number":386,"total_pages":394},"hash":"pCrcp63H0r8uDG594xUKaVdJFU8aPtrUu31nHKHxgBk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"51d8a6e6-2364-4f16-b688-586843849351","metadata":{"page_number":386,"total_pages":394},"hash":"J3AxiqUqmL7di236oYsyJEvSOAzdiV+UfbXVvg2Hscg="}},"text":"Should you find any such damage, discontinue use of the cable.
